/// Message spec 4.1 (IPython 2.0) added a messaging system for developers to add their own objects
/// with Frontend and Kernel-side components, and allow them to communicate with each other. To do
/// this, IPython adds a notion of a Comm, which exists on both sides, and can communicate in either
/// direction.
///
/// These messages are fully symmetrical - both the Kernel and the Frontend can send each message,
/// and no messages expect a reply. The Kernel listens for these messages on the Shell channel, and
/// the Frontend listens for them on the IOPub channel.
/// 
/// Since comm messages can execute arbitrary user code, handlers should set the parent header and
/// publish status busy / idle, just like an execute request.

/// responsible for maintaining a mapping of target_name keys to constructors. After a comm_open
/// message has been sent, there should be a corresponding Comm instance on both sides. The data
/// key is always a dict and can be any extra JSON information used in initialization of the comm.
/// 
/// If the target_name key is not found on the receiving side, then it should immediately reply with
/// a [comm_close](CommClose) message to avoid an inconsistent state.
